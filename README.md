This repository contains our implementation of the Game of Life, a cellular automaton created by mathematician John Conway. The project allowed us to deepen our understanding of component-based programming, interfaces, and GUI design.

## Key Features:
### Component-Based Architecture:
The project was built using modular, reusable components, making the codebase clean and maintainable.
### Interfaces:
We leveraged interfaces to ensure flexibility and decoupling between various parts of the application, adhering to key principles of object-oriented programming.
### GUI:
A user-friendly graphical interface was implemented, enabling users to visualize and interact with the Game of Life simulation.
### Maven Integration:
The build process and dependencies were managed efficiently with Maven, helping us structure the project according to best practices in Java development.
### PostgreSQL Database:
We integrated a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve simulation states, enabling users to save progress and reload previous states.
